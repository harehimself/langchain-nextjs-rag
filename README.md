   This repository contains a simple experimental app built with Next.js, LangChain, and OpenAI to demonstrate RAG (retrieval augmented generation). RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval and language generation to produce more informed and contextual responses. The app leverages Next.js for the front-end, LangChain for managing the retrieval and generation process, and OpenAI's language model for the generation component. It serves as a proof-of-concept for integrating RAG into web applications.
